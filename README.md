## Abstract

Light grants us the capacity to perceive, making it an essential and powerful tool for visual artists. This thesis explores the possibilities of visual phenomena and perception by harnessing the immaterial and transient nature of light. 

In the summer of 2012, I traveled throughout Europe, visiting studios, interviewing artists, and experiencing light-based installations. These experiences inspired sketches, notes, and photographs that informed my subsequent studio work. Over the year-long study, I experimented with lighting technologies to fabricate miniature installations, wearable mirrored apparatuses, and light-based sculptures. 

### Highlights:
- **Wearable Mirrored Ocular Devices**: Immersive experiences that distort and fragment the viewer's perception into an omnipresently-twisted vision.  
- **Light Reflections in Space**: Mirrors channel light to transform entire gallery spaces into dynamic optical experiences.  
- **Infinite Lightscapes**: Sculptures and installations reveal vast, infinite landscapes shaped by light, heightening our awareness of the natural world.  

My research culminated in a series of sculptures and images that compel viewers to stare into the invisible operations of optics, experiencing light as both a medium and a subject.
